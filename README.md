# Calendar Tracking  
<br />



## Why track your time?  
Have you ever asked yourself where your time goes? Or have you ever wished you could remember what you were doing on a specific day in the past?

Back in 2012 I was very curious on how I spent my 10,080 minutes in a week and decided to track my life in a calendar. I wanted to:
- easily remember past events
- learn more about myself
- become a better planner
- increase my productivity
- change personal behaviour
- have a visualization of my life
- leave a digital legacy

Here are some other great people that track their life in a calendar:

## How does this all work?  
The easiest way is to create events in a calendar. Use a calendar service such as [Apple Calendar](https://www.icloud.com/calendar/) or [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) that acts as a central storage and allows all your calendar apps to connect and automatically synchronise events with each other.

## What setup do you specifically use?  
My setup consists of a [Nextcloud](http://nextcloud.com/) server that keeps my iPhone, iPad, and iMac calendars in sync.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/107208579/tracking/blob/main/img/Calendar_Personal_Setup.png" width="740">    
</p>


My setup has different calendars, such as Education, Employment, Errands, Entertainment, Food, Health, Housework, Hygiene, Projects, Rest, Socialising, Sports, and Transportation.
* EDU  
* EMP   
* ENT  
* ERR  
* FOO  
* HEA  
* HOU  
* HYG  
* PRO  
* RES  
* SOC  
* SPO  
* TRA   
* …  

Each logged even receives a different event title with more details:
* EMP - Work
* EMP - Meeting
* EMP - Interview 
* ENT - Computer
* ENT - Television
* TRA - Walk  
* TRA - Bus  
* TRA - Car  
* …

I modify events directly in the [macOS Calendar](http://support.apple.com/guide/calendar/welcome/mac) or in [BusyCal](https://www.busymac.com/busycal/) if required.

</p>
<br />
<br />

The smallest event duration logged is 5 minutes. Here are some event example events:

<img src="https://github.com/107208579/tracking/blob/main/img/Calendar_Event_003.png" width="250">
</p>
<br />
<br />



On the go, I log events on my iPhone via some of these 'one-click' [iOS shortcuts](https://github.com/107208579/calendar-tracking/tree/main/shortcuts) bookmarks.

<br />
<br />



At home I use wireless switches that allow me to log events via a simple button press. I've written up a tutorial on how to get a Raspberry Pi OS base installation and how to setup Zigbee switches with all required software here: https://github.com/107208579/calendar-tracking/blob/main/switches/setup.md
