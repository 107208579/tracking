## Why track your time?  
Have you ever asked yourself where your time goes? Or have you ever wished you could remember what you were doing on a specific day in the past? How do you spend your 10,080 minutes in a week? 

I've been tracking my life since 2012, mainly to:
- remember past events
- learn about myself
- plan better for the future
- change personal behaviour
- leave a legacy

Here are some great people that also track their life via a calendar:

## How does this all work?  
The easiest way is to create events in a calendar. Use a calendar service such as [Apple iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/calendar/) or [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) that acts as a central storage and allows all your calendar apps to connect and synchronise events.

## How do you personally track your time?  
I run a self-hosted [Nextcloud](http://nextcloud.com/) server which keeps my iPhone, iPad, and iMac calendars in sync via CalDAV. I also log calendar events via a simple button press.

* [Zigbee Buttons](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_devices.html) + [Zigbee Receiver](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html) + Linux Server + [zigbee2mqtt](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io) + [mqtt2caldav](https://github.com/107208579/mqtt2caldav)

My calendar separates life categories with different colour-coded calendars, such as Education, Employment, Entertainment, Food, Housework, Hygiene, Rest, Sports, Transportation, etc
* EDU   
* EMP   
* ENT   
* FOO  
* HOU  
* HYG  
* RES  
* SPO  
* TRA  
* ‚Ä¶

Each calendar has a different event title that allows me to have additional details:
* ENT - Book  
* ENT - Computer  
* ENT - Game  
* ENT - Television  
* HOU - Cleaning  
* HOU - Laundry  
* HOU - Maintenance    
* TRA - Walk  
* TRA - Bus  
* TRA - Car  
* TRA - Walk  
* ‚Ä¶
