## Why track your time?  
Have you ever asked yourself where your time goes? Or have you ever wished you could remember what you were doing on a specific day in the past?

What if I said that all you need to do is to track your time in a calendar?


I've been tracking 
- To remember past events
- To learn about myself
- To change my behavior
- To leave a legacy

Here are some great people that track their life via a calendar:

## How does this all work?  


Simply create an event in a calendar. If you want to sync calendars across different devices then choose calendar apps that support CalDAV synchronisation.

To work with CalDAV you need a server that acts as central repository of your calendar data. The central server allows devices and calendar apps to independently connect and synchronise data. In my case I use [Nextcloud](http://nextcloud.com)
