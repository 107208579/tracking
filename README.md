# Calendar Tracking  
<br />

## Why track your time?  
Have you ever asked yourself where your time goes? Or have you ever wished you could remember what you were doing on a specific day in the past?

Back in 2012 I was very curious on how I spend my 10,080 minutes in a week and decided to track my life in calendar. I wanted to:
- easily remember past events
- learn more about myself
- plan better ahead
- have a visualization of my life
- increase my productivity
- change personal behaviour
- leave a digital legacy

Here are some other great people that track their life in a calendar:

## How does this all work?  
The easiest way is to create events in a calendar. Use a calendar service such as [Apple iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/calendar/) or [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) that acts as a central storage and allows all your calendar apps to connect and automatically synchronise events with each other.

## What setup do you use specifically?  
I have a [Nextcloud](http://nextcloud.com/) server running which keeps my iPhone, iPad, and iMac calendars via CalDAV in sync. On the go, I mostly log events on my iPhone via [iOS Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios). At home I use Zigbee switches that allow me to log events via a simple button press. I also modify events in the [macOS Calendar](http://support.apple.com/guide/calendar/welcome/mac) app or via [BusyCal](https://www.busymac.com/busycal/) if really required.

</p>

My setup has different calendars, such as Employment, Entertainment, Transportation, etc
* EMP   
* ENT   
* TRA   
* ‚Ä¶

Each event receives a different event title with more details:
* EMP - Work
* EMP - Meeting
* EMP - Interview 
* ENT - Computer
* ENT - Television
* TRA - Walk  
* TRA - Bus  
* TRA - Car  
* ‚Ä¶

The smallest event duration logged is 5 minutes. Here are some event example events:

</p>
<br />
<br />

On my iPhone I have created one-touch [iOS Shortcut](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) bookmarks:

</p>
<br />
<br />


At home I have several battery powered [Zigbee switches](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_devices.html) that send a wireless signal upon a button press. The signal is received by a [Zigbee antenna](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html) and forwarded to a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) who creates a new calendar event on my central [Nextcloud](http://nextcloud.com/) server. From there, all events are sync'ed via CalDAV across all connected calendars.

I've written up a tutorial on how to get a Raspberry Pi OS [base installation](https://github.com/107208579/calendar-tracking/blob/main/setup_zigbee/1_setup_raspberrypi.txt) and how to setup Zigbee switches with all [required software](https://github.com/107208579/calendar-tracking/blob/main/setup_zigbee/2_setup_zigbee.txt).
