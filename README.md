# Calendar Tracking  
<br />

## Why track your time?  
Have you ever asked yourself where your time goes? Or have you ever wished you could remember what you were doing on a specific day?

I had the same questions back in 2012 and wanted to know how I spend my 10,080 minutes in a week - so I decided to start tracking my life in a calendar.

I specifically wanted to:
- learn more about myself
- become a better planner
- increase my productivity
- change personal behaviour
- easily remember past events
- have a visualization of my life
- leave a digital legacy
<br />
<br />


## How does calendar tracking work?  
The easiest way is to log all your events in a calendar, export the data, and then analyze it.


Use a service such as [Apple Calendar](https://www.icloud.com/calendar/) or [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) as central storage which automatically syncs between

Not a fan of applications with timers where you need to start and stop an event - easy to forget.

## What setup do you specifically use?  
My setup consists of a [Nextcloud](http://nextcloud.com/) server that keeps my iPhone, iPad, and iMac calendars in sync.

I have different calendars, such as Education, Employment, Errands, Entertainment, Food, Health, Housework, Hygiene, Projects, Rest, Socialising, Sports, and Transportation.
* EDU  
* EMP   
* ENT  
* ERR  
* FOO  
* HEA  
* HOU  
* HYG  
* PRO  
* RES  
* SOC  
* SPO  
* TRA   
* …  

Each logged event receives a different event title with more details:
* EMP - Work
* EMP - Meeting
* EMP - Interview 
* ENT - Computer
* ENT - Television
* TRA - Walk  
* TRA - Bus  
* TRA - Car  
* …

I modify events directly in the [macOS Calendar](http://support.apple.com/guide/calendar/welcome/mac) or in [BusyCal](https://www.busymac.com/busycal/) if required.

The smallest event duration logged is 5 minutes. Here are some event example events:

</p>
<br />
<br />



On the go, I log events on my iPhone via some of these 'one-click' [iOS shortcuts](https://github.com/107208579/calendar-tracking/blob/main/shortcuts/README.md) bookmarks.

At home I use wireless switches that allow me to log events via a simple button press. I've written up a tutorial on how to get a Raspberry Pi OS base installation and how to setup Zigbee switches with all required software here: https://github.com/107208579/calendar-tracking/blob/main/switches/README.md.
