# Calendar Tracking (Shortcuts)
<br />


## Notes
• Shortcuts that create a new event, will automatically round the event start time up or down to the nearest 5 minute. As an example, if a shortcut is run at 11:22:35, the event start time will be rounded up to 11:25:00. If a shortcut is run at 11:22:25, the event start time will be rounded down to 11:20:00,

• An Apple device with vibration functionality will vibrate 1x if an event was rounded down, and will vibrate 2x if an event was rounded up.<br />



Shortcuts will extend the event duration by 5 minutes when an event already exists during the same time-frame.
